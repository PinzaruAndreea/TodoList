# TodoList

This is to do list created through HTML and CSS, with the added functionality of a few JS functions. The user could add a new to do item, delete a current item from the list and search the current list. At first, the problem with this was that, when the user refreshed the page, all the data that was previously added, would be erased. So, I learned how to link a site through JS code into a database, so, of course, I added the feature to this project too.
